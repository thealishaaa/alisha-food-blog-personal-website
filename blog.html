                        For me, the ice cream and beverages of Mixue are delicious and the price is really reasonable for a student like me.
                        Can you imagine, an ice cream with cone costs for only RM2 and a cup of lemonade costs for only RM3.
                        There are many other beverages that can quench your thirst during the sunny day since these few days with the afforable price.

                        My favourite here is Boba Sundae which is RM5 only. You can click <a href="http://www.mixuemalaysia.com/menu">here </a> to check their products.
